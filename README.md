# smart-routing_dijkstra_bellman
📡 Optimized Routing with Adaptive Dijkstra &amp; Bellman-Ford This project implements and compares adaptive versions of Dijkstra’s and Bellman-Ford algorithms to find optimal routing paths in communication networks. It focuses on improving routing efficiency by dynamically selecting the best algorithm based on network conditions.
